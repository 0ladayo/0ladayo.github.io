This project demonstrates an end-to-end, event-driven ELT pipeline for analyzing personal fitness (running) data. It extracts activity data from the Strava API, loads it into Google BigQuery, and runs transformations using dbt. The entire serverless infrastructure on GCP is defined and provisioned with Terraform.
