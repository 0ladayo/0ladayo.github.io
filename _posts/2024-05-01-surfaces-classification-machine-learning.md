---

This machine learning project focused on the classification of surface types using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset was collected from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) mounted to a rollator (a type of mobility aid), with data recorded across five different surface types: Asphalt, Concrete, Grass, Stone, and Tile.

The developed model demonstrated strong performance, achieving approximately 93% accuracy and a 93% F1-score on unseen test data.
